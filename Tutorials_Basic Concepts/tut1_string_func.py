Following are the functions that work on a string: 

# count() - it counts the number of incidents at which the particular letter/word has appeared in the text
# endswith() - check if the string ends with that particular word 
# find() - finds the first instance at which that particular letter/word appears in the string
# replace(old_word,new_word) - replaces the old word in a string with a new word provided.
# isalnum()- checks if the string provided is alphanumeric. 
    Works only when all characters in the string are alphanumeric.Won't work if there is a space.
# isalpha() - checks if the string is alphabetical. 
    Works only when all characters in the string are alphabetical. Won't work if there is a space.
# capitalize() - capitalizes the first word 
# upper()
# lower()
# type-casting : it is a method of changing the type of a dataset eg. string can be converted into 
integer by typecasting : int(string)
# Note : advanced slicing or extended slicing is eg. my_str[::7000] i.e when the last element of slicing is a number 
 way beyond the length of the string, it will simply print the first number and will not throw any error
